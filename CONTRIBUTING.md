#### Adding features and modifying the theme

Before making any large changes to Novela please create an issue to discuss the change or a draft PR. Our aim is to keep this project simple to use without too much configuration.

We also deeply value design so any new feature must pass our design review.

#### Fixing typos, syntax errors, and types

We're more than happy with PRs that fix typos, syntax errors, and types. You do not have to create an issue or request a fix to these.
